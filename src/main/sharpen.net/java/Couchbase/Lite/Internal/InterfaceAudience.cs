	/// <remarks>
	/// Annotations to help mark methods as being public or private.  This is needed to
	/// help with the issue that Java‚Äôs scoping is not very complete. One is often forced to
	/// make a class public in order for other internal components to use it. It does not have
	/// friends or sub-package-private like C++
	/// Motivated by http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/InterfaceClassification.html
